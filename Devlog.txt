1. SDL_UpdateTexture vs SDL_Lock/UnlockTexture to modify the Texture data

SDL_UpdateTexture is only meant for static texture uploads whereas SDL_Lock/is intended purely for write operations

2. Use SDL_PIXELFORMAT_ARGB8888 and not SDL_PIXELFORMAT_RGBA8888, as the texture would have to be converted each frame since on GPU we store SDL_PIXELFORMAT_ARGB8888
